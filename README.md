## Dependencies

You need clang or gcc >=4.7. You also need to install:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libpng12-dev libjpeg-dev \
        libfreetype6-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev \
        libswscale-dev libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev ragel

## Installation

    wget https://github.com/jart/hiptext/releases/download/0.2/hiptext-0.2.tar.gz
    tar xvzf hiptext-0.2.tar.gz
    cd hiptext-0.2

    ./configure
    make -j4
    sudo make install

## Usage

### Images

Most image types, e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc. are supported.

### Videos

You can play videos in your terminal using hiptext. Yes, really.

### Miscellaneous

## Rendering Modes

### xterm256

By default, hiptext assumes you're using an xterm256 compatible terminal,
e.g. gnome-terminal, without bothering to check the `TERMINAL` environment
variable.

    hiptext --xterm256 balls.png

To double the number of pixels using Unicode half blocks, consider using the
following option, which may become the default in the future:

    hiptext --xterm256unicode balls.png

### MacTerm

The most beautiful terminal for hiptext is the one built into Mac OS X called
Terminal.app. This terminal uses xterm256 but it's implemented using a custom
color palette that was chosen by designers rather than engineers.

But the interesting thing about this palette is that it uses slightly different
colors for foreground and background. By using Unicode half blocks, this allows
us to simulate something closer to 512 colors!

However to use this, you *must* be using the black color scheme. After all, why
would you use anything else?

### Unicode

If you want to render an image without the ANSI color escape codes, you can use
the `--nocolor` flag. This will render the image using shaded unicode block
characters.

### ASCII

The no-color mode supports a very simple character quantiser that can convert
images to ASCII. Please understand that if this is what you want, there are
much better tools for the job, like cacalib.

### SIXEL

If you use a SIXEL terminal, e.g. mlterm >=v3.1.3, then the following flags can
provide much more minute rendering:

    hiptext --sixel256 balls.png           # For 256-color SIXEL terminal such as mlterm (>=v3.1.3)
    hiptext --sixel16 balls.png            # For 16-color SIXEL terminal such as xterm(patch level >= #294) with "-ti vt340 option"
    hiptext --sixel2 balls.png             # For monochrome SIXEL terminals

## Configuration

### Background

By default, hiptext assumes that your terminal background is black. If this is
not the case, you can specify your background color using a CSS or X11 color
string.
